# Azure And Graph

Samples from the corresponding session at #collabsummit 2023.

## Develop functional solutions with Azure Functions and Microsoft Graph

The Azure platform offers many services for the development of individual IT solutions. In this session, we focus on a real-world scenario and insights that we had while working with Azure services.  
In our team, we developed a solution implemented with Microsoft Graph and serverless computing. In the first attempts we came across issues such as architectural problems, timing and throttling. Other topics that we had to solve are authentication, security, monitoring and analysis from operation with Azure Functions. See how we solved them and how you can develop working solutions with Microsoft Graph, Azure Functions, Azure Key Vault, Azure Monitoring and other Azure services.
